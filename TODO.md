# To Do

* Add:
  - planes
  - shadows
  - reflection/refraction
  - other light types (e.g. spherical)
  
  from [here](https://bheisler.github.io/post/writing-raytracer-in-rust-part-2/)
* Read scene from a file (so it can be changed without having to recompile)
* Add additional light types ([ideas](http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.0/308/))
* Make the scene definition language at least partially [POVRay compatible](http://www.povray.org/documentation/3.7.0/r3_0.html)
* Add other geometrical primatives (cubes, triangles, cylinders, cones, ...)
* Add complex geometical primitives (torus? prisms? polygons? ...)
* Optimise a bit (and remove as much `.clone()`'ing as possible)
