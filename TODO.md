* Read scene from a file (so it can be changed without having to recompile)
* Add planes
* Add other light types (e.g. spherical)
* Make the scene definition language at least partially POVRay compatible
* Add other geometrical primatives (cubes, triangles, cylinders, cones)
* Add complex geometical primitives (torus?, prisms?, polygons?)
* Optimise a bit (and remove as much `.clone()`'ing as possible?
