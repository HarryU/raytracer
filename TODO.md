# To Do

[x] Add:
  - ~~planes~~
  - ~~shadows~~
  - ~~reflection/refraction~~
  - ~~spherical lights~~
  - ~~textures from images~~
  
  from [here](https://bheisler.github.io/post/writing-raytracer-in-rust-part-2/)
[x] ~~Read scene from a file (so it can be changed without having to recompile)~~
[ ] Make camera adjustable:
  - movable
  - posable
  - focus
  - distortion?
[ ] Add additional light types ([ideas](http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.0/308/))
[ ] Make the scene definition language at least partially [POVRay compatible](http://www.povray.org/documentation/3.7.0/r3_0.html)
[ ] Add other geometrical primatives (cubes, triangles, cylinders, cones, ...)
[ ] Add complex geometical primitives (torus? prisms? polygons? ...)
[ ] Optimise a bit ~~(and remove as much `.clone()`'ing as possible)~~
[ ] Make lights "glint" off reflective objects
[ ] Make refractive spheres focus light
