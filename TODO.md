* Read scene from a file (so it can be changed without having to recompile)
* Add [planes and reflection/refraction](https://bheisler.github.io/post/writing-raytracer-in-rust-part-2/)
* Add other light types (e.g. spherical)
* Make the scene definition language at least partially POVRay compatible
* Add other geometrical primatives (cubes, triangles, cylinders, cones, ...)
* Add complex geometical primitives (torus? prisms? polygons? ...)
* Optimise a bit (and remove as much `.clone()`'ing as possible)
